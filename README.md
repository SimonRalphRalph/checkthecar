# Check-A-Car

**Check-A-Car** is an open-source project that transforms the UKâ€™s publicly available **DVSA MOT dataset** into an accessible, visual resource for drivers, researchers, and enthusiasts.  

The goal: make it easy to explore reliability trends, common failure points, mileage patterns, emissions, and tax information across makes and models of cars tested in the UK.

## Features

**Search by make and model** â€” see how different vehicles perform over time.  
**Aggregated MOT statistics** â€” pass rates, age curves, mileage distributions.  
**Failure reasons** â€” grouped into categories (brakes, tyres, emissions, etc.).  
**Recalls & defects** â€” timelines of official recalls by manufacturer and model.  
**Environmental data** â€” COâ‚‚, MPG, and Vehicle Excise Duty (VED) bands.  
**Automated pipeline** â€” fresh datasets are pulled and processed weekly via GitHub Actions.
